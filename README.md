✈️ Airlines Flight Delay Prediction – Project Overview
________________________________________
1. Abstract
Flight delays are a common issue in the aviation industry, resulting in significant economic losses and passenger dissatisfaction.
This project applies machine learning techniques on airline flight Data to predict flight delays based on factors such as airline, route, departure time, weather, and distance.
By analyzing patterns and building predictive models, the project aims to assist airlines in better scheduling and resource optimization.

2. Introduction
    •	Flight delays are influenced by multiple factors (air traffic, weather, operational inefficiencies).
    •	Predicting delays helps minimize disruptions.
    •	The project focuses on binary classification:
          o	0 = On-time
          o	1 = Delayed

3. Dataset Description
    •	Source: Airlines Flight Dataset (CSV/Excel).
    •	Size: ~X rows, Y features (replace with actual).
    •	Features (examples):
          o	Airline, Flight Number, Departure Time, Arrival Time, Distance, Origin Airport, Destination Airport, Weather Condition.
    •	Target Variable: Delay (0/1).

5. Methodology
5.1 Data Preprocessing
    •	Handle missing values (mean/median).
    •	Remove duplicates.
    •	Encode categorical variables (Airline, Airport).
    •	Scale continuous features (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler).
5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    •	Distribution of delays across airlines & airports.
    •	Impact of flight distance and departure time.
    •	Correlation heatmap to detect feature relationships.
5.3 Feature Engineering
    •	Create derived features:
          o	Peak Hour Indicator
          o	Flight Duration Category
          o	Weather Impact Score

6. Models Used
    •	Logistic Regression
    •	Decision Tree Classifier
    •	Random Forest Classifier
    •	XGBoost

8. Results & Key Findings
    •	Random Forest and XGBoost showed the best performance (higher accuracy & F1).
    •	Delay probability is strongly affected by:
          o	Departure time (late-night/early-morning flights are less delayed).
          o	Weather conditions.
          o	Busy airports and long routes.
